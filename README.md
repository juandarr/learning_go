## Initialize a new go project

A go project can defined as a module itself.
- Create a folder to store the project
- Initialize a new go module with `go mod init mod_name`, where `mod_name` is the name you assign to the module
- Every go file is part of a package. It needs to be declared at the top
- Write your program. After completion you can:
  - Run it with `go run file_name`
  - Build it with `go build file_name`
